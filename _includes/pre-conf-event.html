Whether you have already submitted several pull requests or are just entering the world of Keycloak - everyone is welcome! The goal? To improve Keycloak! Whether you are working on new features and bug fixes, improving the documentation, promoting multilingualism or organizing issues in the issue tracker - everything counts.
                                        We especially want to motivate people who may not have actively contributed so far. We offer the perfect opportunity to make an initial contribution, be it through code, documentation or organizational work.</p>
